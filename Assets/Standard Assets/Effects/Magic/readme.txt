Thank you for purchasing this package


You can add a lot of variety to the effects by changing the MIN-MAX Emission values and the Color Animation parameters.

Open the Fx scene included in this package and press the Play button to see the effects in-game, or place the prefabs in the level for starting your own customisations

Follow these simple rules to mantain a good looking effect:

Try leave the size under 5-6, otherwise you will probably have visual issues caused by the resolution of the texture.
Do not decrease too much the "Min Energy" value
Do not increase too much the "Max Emission" if the effect is looping and spawning always in the same position ( Ellipsoid range 0-0-0 )

And for the sake of performance, turn off Cast Shadows and Receive Shadows ( From Particle Renderer ) in any of the new effects you`re going to create.

If you are developing for mobile you will probably want to turn down the resolution to 512x512 to make them less expensive
